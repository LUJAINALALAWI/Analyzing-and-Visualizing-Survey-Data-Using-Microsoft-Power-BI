# Analyzing-and-Visualizing-Survey-Data-Using-Microsoft-Power-BI
This project involves using Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize survey data. Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool that enables users to create interactive reports and dashboards. This project demonstrates how to transform raw survey data into meaningful insights through data visualization.
## Implementation Details
1.	Data Import:
o	Import survey data from sources such as Exce, CSV.
o	Use Power Query to clean and transform the data, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2.	Data Modeling:
o	Use DAX to create calculated columns and measures for deeper analysis.
3.	Creating Visuals:
o	Use various Power BI visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to represent survey responses.
o	Implement custom visuals to better illustrate specific data points or trends.
4.	Building Dashboards:
o	Design interactive dashboards that provide an overview of the survey results.
o	Use slicers and filters to allow users to drill down into specific segments of the data.
